SUMMARY
-----------------------

When you run program it will ask for the SPC. It should work just as you asked for it, where if you specify the SPC like so: "FOF_HOF_*" it will give all the different problems with the FOF_HOF SPC. If you do "FOF_*_THE_MOS_*" it should also work with different combinations of SPC. Further, you can specify the file directory that contains the file that needs to be read.
